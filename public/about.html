            <p>
                ChatoRoom started as an alternative to something. Our product now supports
                sending and receiving a variety of media: text. Our messages and
                calls are secured with end-to-end encryption, meaning that no third
                party including WhatsApp can read or listen to them. Behind every
                product decision is our desire to let people communicate anywhere in
                the world without barriers.
